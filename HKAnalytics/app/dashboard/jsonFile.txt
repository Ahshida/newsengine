      "text": "Quote: Singaporeans like myself owe a big Thanks to Mr Lee & his team for keeping Singapore safe both internally and externally over the decades. Heard on the radio regarding NS speeches etc, looking at the security situation today, the strength of the SAF. Easy to take for granted the capabilities today but reality was the hard work put in through all the decades to get to where the current abilities are. Not least the political will to make it happen.\nWonder if LKY had not put his son through NS to become a BG, will the leadership team still have the strong security focus today? Just look across the border...\nYou created the peace, now you can rest in peace, Mr Lee!\nFare ye well, Mr. LKY.",

Without LKY Singapore would have been doomed as under the British it was one of the most corrupt places on earth. Westerners hate Singapore because of its success. This is because of their jealously. How in the world could Singapore ever become a first world country when the neighbours are all reeking of corruption, crime, kleptocracy, racism, religious intolerance where Presidents like Suharto and Marcos were mass m u r d e r e r s or tyrants like Mahathir that looted and robbed their own country and played communities against each other using the divide and rule playbook left over from the colonialists. But LKY would have none of the nonsense and instead build a disciplined, fair and equitable inclusive society.",

      "text": "Living the LKY dream, in full colour Published on Mar 25, 2015 2:24 AM PRINT EMAIL \nSOME time in the 1970s, a boy stood on a small hill in Lorong Ah Soo, pointed to a faraway distance and asked his little sister: \"Do you know what they are going to build there? They are going to build a new airport.\" \nThe little sister looked in awe at the brother and both stared into the woods for a long time. \nThe little sister was me - I was born in 1965, Singapore's year of independence. \nIn 1972, our family bade the villagers farewell and moved into a three-room flat in Circuit Road. \nIt was truly an eye-opener for our family. \nThere was a flushing toilet - a far cry from the stinking shed in the village. \nWe found new friends and started our new lives. \nA few families would gather at one home watching TV on the black and white set. \nWe will never forget the day our father bought the first colour TV in the neighbourhood - it sparked flurries of excitement and curiosity, and neighbours flocked to our house every night after that just to catch a glimpse of TV shows in colour. \nThe years flew by, and we grew up witnessing Singapore's rapid advancement, its social stability, as well as its economic and political success - even through economic crises - in becoming a recognisable red dot on the world map. \nThis success crept up on us silently, safely enveloping us all, ensuring we lived in harmony, peace and prosperity. \nThe soon-to-be-built airport my brother pointed out became the acclaimed, award-winning Changi Airport. \nMr Lee Kuan Yew, the founding father of modern Singapore, was a man who had, in his head, a three-dimensional vision of Singapore today, even way back in 1965. \nWe have lost a great leader and it is a loss of indescribable magnitude. \nChan Wei Sum (Madam) ",

      "text": "  25 ― Following the death of modern Singapore's founding father Lee Kuan Yew, the Chinese world will have lost a truly revered politician. \nAlthough LKY has left us, he has nevertheless left behind a rich legacy of his wisdom, policies and systems that are poised to benefit the future generations. \nThere are several attributes of LKY that deserve genuine respect from the world over, including his pragmatic way of doing things, corruption-free and highly efficient leadership as well as his full dedication towards his country. \nAfter Singapore was separated from Malaysia, it was indeed not easy for a tiny island devoid of natural resources. Lee had to be really practical, so he adopted the most practical way of developing the sovereignty state's economy, establishing a path that belonged to Singapore while creating an economic miracle. \nLKY opted for the English-first educational policy as English was the predominant language in the world during those years while most of the professional talents were from English-speaking countries. If the newly independent state were to embroil itself in education controversies, it would indeed be very hard for it to move forward. \nBecause of his English-first educational policy, LKY invited criticisms for sidelining or even wiping out Chinese education on the island. He closed down Nanyang University because of national interests and needs. \nBut with China becoming increasingly powerful, LKY made frequent visits to the country, and was the architect behind the Suzhou Industrial Park in China. He also actively promoted the learning of Mandarin. To him, anything that favoured Singapore would be adopted by him. While such an attitude could be cold-hearted at times, it was nevertheless vastly successful. \nThanks to his sharp observation, LKY seldom erred in his decision-making. And in the event he made a mistake, he would not overlook it for the sake of his own self-respect. \nLKY built a highly efficient and incorrupt bureaucracy and laid a formidable foundation for a prosperous Singapore. \nHe led by example to wipe out corruption because of his powerful determination and resolution. \nHe treasured talented people irrespective of their ethnic backgrounds. While the island republic has no natural resources, it has been backed up by a pool of high-caliber brains hailing from across the world. \nHe believed a government ought to be led by capable people in order to put in place an efficient government. \nHis other strength was a deep sense of crisis. He always anticipated the worst to come and therefore constantly upgraded the versatility of Singapore's economy, from the manufacturing industry to entrepôt, free trade, financial center to services industry, pharmaceuticals to the gaming industry, he made Singapore's economy truly diversified. \nLKY can no longer watch over the country he once built up from scratch. Many would ask where Singapore would be headed from here and whether it would retain its prosperity and stability. This would not be problem if Lee Hsien Loong and his successors could inherit the systems and policies he left behind. \nWe could safely say that history had offered LKY a good opportunity to display his competencies. The departure of Singapore from Malaysia gave LKY some space to test out his political ideologies which were eventually proven workable. \nA mention of LKY would not be complete without touching on Malaysia. These two countries that used to start at more or less the same level in mid 20th century have demonstrated vast differences today. Malaysia is still plagued by a plethora of racial and religious controversies and arguments between secularism and hudud law. \nIt was right for Singapore to wean itself from ethnic politics, or sensitive racial, religious and linguistic issues will consume this tiny city-state. \nSingapore was forced into independence during the turbulent years. LKY had to be firm in his decisions and had done his utmost for his nation and people. That said, his iron-fisted rule including his alleged control of democratic movements and liberty as well as his paternalistic leadership, had also made him a target of merciless criticisms. \n* This is the personal opinion of the writer or organisation   views of Malay Mail Online .

As you yourself concede, LKY gaoled political opponents, wrecked their lives, suppressed freedom of speech with confected defamation etc. I was not silent when others were prepared to gloss over it as if nothing untoward had happened. But you seem to prefer that I should have remained silent about it, when any mention of repression is taken to be 'exaggeration'. Unlike you, I don't think that repression was the preferred or only road to economic security, nor do I think that alternative paths necessarily entailed 'starvation', 'chaos' or 'racial conflict'.",

I think a small SSD is not a solution in a 24/7 box!\nThe SSDs are coming with their own controller chip on the SSD itselfs\nand they are trying to store data even not on the same sectors (blocks)\nby using the wear leveling algorithm, to gaining the entire life time of the\nSSD and they are taking even a part of the entire SSD as cache for the data.\nSo if now the SSD is a great model, likes 256 GB, 512 GB or 1TB the wear\nleveling algorithm is able to spread the data on many more free and unused\nsectors as on a smaller one and on top it is able to take more space for caching\nproposals lkies, 64 GB = 4 GB, 128 GB = 8 GB, 256 GB = 16 GB, 512 GB = 32 GB and 1TB = 64 GB\nSo you can see the entire lifetime and speed will be gaining on a greater modell from the same series!!",

      "text": "Lee Kuan Yew's body moved to Singapore parliament for mourning 25 March 2015 From the section Asia Mr Lee was admired by world leaders though many criticised his strict control over Singapore The body of Singaporean statesman Lee Kuan Yew is being moved by gun carriage from his official residence to parliament where it will lie in state. \nMr Lee, who led the city-state to independence and served as its prime minister for 31 years, died on Monday at the age of 91. \nSingapore is observing a week of mourning for the deeply respected man. \nThousands of people are expected to pay tribute at parliament ahead of the state funeral on Sunday. The coffin will be moved through the city on board a ceremonial gun carriage Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong thanked Singaporeans for their messages of support Thousands have already paid tribute at the Istana \nMr Lee's body has been resting at the Istana - the compound which houses the president's official residence and the prime minister's office - for a private family mourning period. Thousands have already left flowers and message at its gates and signed books of condolence. \nHis flag-draped coffin, accompanied by representatives of the military and government, is now being carried from the Istana through the main shopping and business districts, before arriving at Parliament House. \nMany organisations and businesses are giving employees time off to pay their respects. \nOn Tuesday, Singapore's current prime minster, Mr Lee's son Lee Hsien Loong, thanked all who had paid tribute, via his Facebook page . \nHe also announced that a new orchid - Singapore's national flower - had been named after his father. The orchid, named Aranda Lee Kuan Yew, will also be displayed at parliament house. Global admiration \nLee Kuan Yew - widely known as LKY - oversaw Singapore's independence from Britain and separation from Malaysia and co-founded the People's Action Party (PAP), which has governed Singapore since 1959. Lee Kuan Yew's death sparked an outpouring of grief in the city-state he led to prosperity \nHe was the architect of Singapore's transformation from a dependent, port city to a stable, prosperous independent state and a global financial hub. \nHowever, he also introduced tight control. One of his legacies was a clampdown on the press - tight restrictions that remain in place today - while measures such as corporal punishment have been criticised as repressive. \nDissent - and political opponents - were ruthlessly quashed. Today, PAP remains firmly in control. There are currently six opposition lawmakers in parliament. \nHe was widely admired by world leaders, but criticised what he saw as the overly liberal approach of the US and the West, saying it had \"come at the expense of orderly society\".

This is the best time to curse him.\nLKY destroyed so many people's life and just because they have a different opinion from him and want to serve the country..\nLee kuan Yew want to be in the limelight all by himself and control the media just to shine light onto him and his party daily...and brainwashing the citizens in the country and even the young school children by using their learning material and textbooks.\nThis is pure self-interest and such a person has no place in heaven.. heaven is about sincerity and self-lessness...there is non in Lee kuan yew..\nBy the fact of destroying so many people's life, he will fall to HELL!!!!",

      "text": "Transmodified from Mouth Piece hxxp://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/france-has-lost-a-friend/1736674.html\nPEASANTPORE: Frenchie President Francois Hollander offered his procedural condolences on Monday (Mar 23) after the death of Peasantpore's First Ruler LKY.\n\"The Cohabiting President of the Frenchie Republic has learnt with great sadness of the demise of pro-western Comprador Lee Kuan Yew , first Western approved Ruler of Regime of Peasantpore . As diplomatic courtest, He honors the memory of this pro-western visionary statesman, who was able to guide the remarkable development of Peasantpore since its independence in 1965 with Ang Moh and Nihon investment ,\" he said.\n\"As Peasantpore and France mark the 50th anniversary of the establishment of their diplomatic relations this year, France has lost a pro-western friend who had strived to draw our two nations closer and deepen our cooperation in all fields.\n\"In these moments of mourning of the entire nation aping the example of North Korea , the Head of State addresses his sincere condolences to the immensely favoured and loved ones of Familee and to the peasants of Peasantpore.\"\nFrenchie Minion for Vassal Affairs Laurent Fabius spoke in a separate statement of his \"deep sadness\" upon learning of the passing of Old Dictator.\n\"Former French President Francois Mitterand's a bit tulan with Old Dictator when the latter lectured the former on French governance. Without Yankee support, Ang Moh and Nihon investments and cheap peasant labour, Peasantpore became one of the Asiatic hubs to balk Soviet and Maoist baboons.\"\nWho is this ridiculous man who wastes my time? Running Singapore is like running Marseilles. I am running a whole country !”, peeved Mitterand on LKY's arrogance .\nThe Frenchie Ambassador aka Spymaster to Peasantpore Benjamin Dubertret also sent his condolences and paid tribute to the dead dictator.\n\"In Ang Moh tradition, we will only say the good times in funerals and ignore the not so good parts of the Old Dictator. But we know Old Dictator always send insulting letters to his foes' funeral , so that one, I will not comment. Other than Mitterand's outburst after the LKY lecture, both countries ok ok and steady,\" said Mr Dubertret.\n\"Old Dictator has not ceased to work, throughout his life and his political career, for the accomplishment of a pro-western regime . He supports western concept of an open global market economy for our exploitation. His sold his cheap peasants as pliant labour who will follow our instructions to the dot. Peasantpore may be modern and rich but it is wholly dependent on Western and Nihon investments .\n\"The entire nation has followed North Korea and declared national mourning , as courtesy, we Ang Mohs join the countless voices around the world to express our deepest emotions on his demise and reiterate our most sincere condolences to our favourite Comprador, to Familee and to the peasants of Peasantpore.\"",

      "text": "It's been an honour, Mr Lee WHEN Lee Kuan Yew stepped down from the Cabinet in May 2011 in the immediate aftermath of a general election, it set off yet another round of musings on the future of Singapore \"post-LKY\". The former Prime Minister, after all, defined Singapore. His dominating influence and hand in Singapore policies remained intact long after he handed over the leadership in 1990, when he took a backseat advisory role in government as Senior Minister and later, Minister Mentor. But the man himself rejected even any \"statesman\" label, telling journalists just a few years ago, in his own inimitable way, that \"anybody who thinks he's a statesman needs to see a psychiatrist\". He had been asked, in an interview for the 2011 book Lee Kuan Yew: Hard Truths To Keep Singapore Going, if he hoped to be remembered by young Singaporeans as perhaps a great statesman, one with tremendous guts. \"No, I don't,\" he said brusquely. \"First of all, I do not classify myself as a statesman. I put myself down as determined, consistent, persistent. I set out to do something, I keep on chasing it until it succeeds. That's all. That's how I perceive myself. Not as a statesman. It's utter rubbish.\" One doesn't \"become a statesman\", according to him, and he would not have been one at all, he said. \"It was circumstances that created me: the defeat of the British, the complete collapse of morale, the Japanese brutality, the re-occupation, the struggle for power between the communists and us as the British were withdrawing. That's what created what I am.\" What he wanted was to be a lawyer. \"Except that had I not chosen politics, who would run this country and what law will you apply?\" A lifelong passion That early conviction and resolve - to free Singapore of its colonial masters, achieve self-rule and build up the tiny island state - became a lifelong passion and commitment to ensure its continued success. Through his twilight years, even after the Republic had, in the eyes of the world, attained cult status as a 20th century economic miracle, he continued to fret over its vulnerability and risks of annihilation, particularly with each new generation of Singaporeans growing up not knowing \"from whence we came\". For him, Singapore was \"an ever-going concern\", foremost in his heart and mind alongside his family. \"Singapore is my concern till the end of my life,\" he declared in Hard Truths. Indeed, the very survival and well-being of Singapore defined his life. His strong sense of purpose, self-belief and decisive judgement - traits that marked his political career - were apparent early on. As he related in The Singapore Story, the first volume of his memoirs, he became de facto head of his family while still in his teens as his mother looked to him, the eldest of five children, rather than his father, on all important family matters. His drive and determination were evident too as a student gunning for academic honours - he was \"disturbed and upset\" upon finding himself beaten to second place in English and economics at Raffles College, \"way behind a certain Miss Kwa Geok Choo\", whom he would later pursue and marry. Mrs Lee - whom Mr Lee described as \"a tower of strength\", his source of \"constant emotional and intellectual support\", died on Oct 2, 2010. But if the socio-economic climate of the day, the trauma and hurly-burly of war and post-war economic depression in 1930s and 1940s Singapore marked his political awakening and shaped his outlook, the three and a half years of Japanese occupation were, for him, the most significant. The period gave him \"vivid insights into the behaviour of human beings and human societies, their motivations and impulses\" and informed his appreciation of governments and \"understanding of power as the vehicle for revolutionary change\", he said in The Singapore Story. The 23-year-old who sailed to England to read law at Cambridge University returned four years later a revolutionary fighter; he and fellow politically active Singapore and Malaya students left England with not only their degrees but also anti-colonial nationalist credentials. Back home, Mr Lee soon made a name for himself representing striking workers in industrial actions, and found in the trade unions the mass support base he and his political comrades needed. And when their People's Action Party (PAP) - launched in November 1954 - won 43 out of 51 seats in the 1959 general election, he became, at 35, prime minister of a self-governing state. Nuts and bolts But if he had been \"uneasy\" about taking power, with \"no experience of administration\", not even in his own law firm then, his anxiety and the weight of his burden were the greater when he found himself suddenly in charge of a newly independent Singapore on Aug 9, 1965, responsible for the lives of two million people. Still, with great vision and boldness, he and his Cabinet got down to the nuts and bolts of governing Singapore. Foremost among his many pressing concerns was to gain international recognition for Singapore's independence and domestically, to build up a defence force, keep law and order and not least, create a viable economy out of an island with no natural resources. And in housing a population then clustered in shanty towns and slum digs, he saw home ownership as a means to forge national belonging. \"After independence in 1965, I was troubled by Singapore's completely urban electorate. I had seen how voters in capital cities always tended to vote against the government of the day and was determined that our householders should become home owners, otherwise we would not have political stability. My other important motive was to give all parents whose sons would have to do National Service a stake in Singapore their sons had to defend,\" he said in his memoir From Third World To First. \"I believed this sense of ownership was vital for our new society which had no deep roots in a common historical experience.\" And in searching \"for some dramatic way to distinguish ourselves from other Third World countries\", he decided that - apart from adopting English as the first language here - a clean and green Singapore would be a competitive advantage: A well-groomed city with tree-lined expressways would signal to investors that Singapore was a disciplined nation that cared about maintenance and order. But of all the policies and institutions he created, the most difficult that he had to implement as Prime Minister was bilingualism as he had proceeded on the wrong assumptions, he said in an interview in 2009. He had been mistaken, he conceded, in assuming that one could be equally fluent in two languages, and in equating intelligence with language ability. Mr Lee, who found his own inability to speak Mandarin and Chinese dialects a big disadvantage early in his political career, made a determined effort to learn the language. In November 2011, he launched what he said was the most important book he had written - on his personal lifelong struggles to master the Chinese language and reclaim his Chinese heritage - and started at the same time a fund to help Singapore children become bilingual early. Most of his philosophies and policies have become hallmarks of the Singapore ethos and system - a highly efficient, clean public service; meritocracy; competitive salaries for ministers; the rule of law; train and bus seats free of sticky chewing gum. His strategies of industrialisation, urbanisation, computerisation and globalisation have propelled Singapore, indeed, from Third World to First within four decades. But he had also been against building casinos in Singapore early on, and initially had grave doubts about going into the life sciences because of a lack of brainpower then. And he did have his share of controversial beliefs and measures, including a number of pronouncements related to women. He once said that \"attractive and intelligent young ladies\" should go to finishing colleges so that they will be \"marvellous helpers of their husband's career\" and declared, on another occasion, that \"we shouldn't get our women into jobs where they cannot, at the same time, be mothers\". Many women here also remember the shock at hearing him once say that he regretted \"allowing\" Singapore females to be highly educated, when the trend emerged in the mid-1980s that the more-educated women were not marrying and producing babies - a problem that persists today. Core beliefs The \"Stop At Two\" population policy of the 1970s and the \"graduate mothers scheme\" that gave the children of graduate mothers priority entry to primary schools were two initiatives that the government eventually scrapped. But Mr Lee - who was given to being candid and matter-of-fact, sometimes to the point of impolitic frankness - held firm certain core beliefs. One was on the subject of nature versus nurture, at one point a topic of debate in Singapore. As recently as July 2011, he said: \"From my empirical observation of people and leaders, I believe 70 to 80 per cent of a person's capability, his proclivities, his temperament, is genetic. The day you were conceived, at least 70 per cent was already fixed in the womb. If you are bound to be a capable person, you will grow into a capable person. If you are bound to be slow, you will be slow. Nothing can change that. You can't choose your parents.\" He did not believe, for instance, that leadership could be taught. \"I think you are a born leader or you are not a leader. You can teach a person to be a manager but not a leader. They must have the extra drive, intellectual verve, an extra tenacity and the will to overcome,\" he said. \"So, I would say . . . 70 per cent of what I am, I was born with it. Twenty to 30 per cent was what I learnt to be what I am.\" Singaporeans, who mostly knew him as a stern, no-nonsense leader, did get glimpses of some of his personal quirks - his disciplined lifestyle, regime of daily swims or bike spins, the cartons of Evian bottled water that were a staple on his work trips, his penchant for air-conditioning. In a 2001 documentary about his life, he named the air-conditioner as the greatest invention of the century, and once wished that someone invented air-conditioned underwear. Describing it to The Asian Wall Street Journal in early 1999, he said that it could be \"a light polyester air-conditioned undergarment, enclosed around the neck, wrists and ankles, and battery-operated\". He added: \"Everyone can then work at his optimum temperature and civilisation can spread across all climates.\" And the softer, stoic side of the man emerged in his distress over Mrs Lee's illness, when he spoke about talking and reading to her every night as she lay inert in bed in her last two years. Age did catch up with him. Mr Lee - who had a pacemaker installed in December 2008 - confronted his own mortality, wondering when the \"last leaf\" would fall, \"grateful to be still around\", and could laugh at himself. As he told The New York Times in an interview published in September 2010: \"I'm reaching 87, trying to keep fit, presenting a vigorous figure, and it's an effort, and is it worth the effort? I laugh at myself trying to keep a bold front. It's become my habit. I just carry on.\" But engage or challenge him on regional geopolitics or a subject close to his heart, such as Singapore's future, and he'd be back to his vigorous, feisty self. Indeed, he kept up a travel schedule even after retiring from the government in May 2011, taking on the role of a \"special envoy\" who continued to promote Singapore's interests abroad. And in early November 2011, when it was revealed that he was battling a neurological disease that made it difficult for him to walk, he said that one \"learns to adjust\", adding: \"I have no doubt at all that this hasn't affected my mind, my will nor my resolve.\" The man whose name is synonymous with Singapore among foreigners, and whom Singaporeans respect and appreciate for his extraordinary vision and lifelong commitment to the country's well-being, certainly also had more than his share of detractors. But as he told NYT's Seth Mydans in an interview published in September 2010, \"I'm not saying that everything I did was right . . . but everything I did was for an honourable purpose.\" The honour, Singaporeans would say, is entirely Singapore's - to have had him as its leader. An architect of the Singapore miracle Lee Kuan Yew's immense contribution can clearly be seen in many aspects of the country's economic landscape. IN much of the writing on Singapore's economic miracle, credit is rightly given to economic policymakers and advisers of extraordinary talent such as Goh Keng Swee and Albert Winsemius. Former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew's contribution is quite often seen as mainly political, providing the political protection for economic planners to push through the right policies. Still, Mr Lee's own direct contributions to economic development should not be underestimated as they went well beyond providing political cover for others. Mr Lee certainly set the overall direction and framework within which breakthrough economic policies were crafted but he also personally took the lead in several aspects of economic development. Setting the political framework Economic policy-making is not just about undertaking the correct technical analysis and making the right judgements on policy design. It is also about politics. At crucial moments in Singapore's turbulent early history, it was Mr Lee who stepped in to provide the political authority which allowed tough policies such as the transformation of labour relations and the union movement in the 1960s to proceed; without that, the Singapore economic miracle would not have materialised. Mr Lee understood that it was not enough to simply lay out the right policies. He realised he had to work the ground to get those policies accepted. Again, using the labour movement as an example, he did not just make speeches at the game-changing NTUC Modernisation Seminar or other such occasions but spent hours coaxing and cajoling the unionists so that they supported the new directions the labour movement would take. Economic policies are always made within a framework which either explicitly or implicitly incorporates some guiding philosophical principles. It was Mr Lee who provided that basic framework and it was fortunate for Singapore that his instincts were in the right direction. This was evident in a range of issues which eventually came to be hallmarks of the Singapore development experience. He realised, for instance, that any business environment had to be supportive of large companies as well as small ones, foreign investors as well as domestic ones, and workers as well as businessmen. He took the lead in breaking away from the dirigiste, state-planning policies of his developing country peers in the 1960s to embrace outward-looking policies that enabled the Singapore economic takeoff. At a time when it was not the intellectual fashion to do so, he accepted that allowing businesses to make good profits would be good for the average man. His instincts were also in the right place when he decided that Singapore should abjure the state-funded welfare policies that many other developing countries had embraced after their independence, insisting instead on creating the culture of self-reliance that has served Singapore so well. By strengthening the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau and placing it under his direct charge, Singapore was able to robustly tackle corruption, creating one of the least corrupt business environments in the world - something that clearly contributes to Singapore's super-competitive economic position. Vision and foresight Singapore is small and highly vulnerable. Yet, it is also remarkably resilient - because it has developed an impressive capacity to bounce back from the shocks or crises that have a habit of erupting every now and then. The reason is that we have learnt from Mr Lee's forceful response each time Singapore faced a severe test. Whether it was the sudden separation from Malaysia in 1965, the equally stunning announcement of the withdrawal of British forces from Singapore in 1968, the two oil shocks of the 1970s or the recession in the mid-1980s, Mr Lee showed the way by mobilising the full resources of the government to find a solution and push its implementation through. This allowed the economy to rebound from each shock, each time emerging even stronger. While Mr Lee was averse to the welfare state, he knew he had to ensure that the fruits of growth were fairly distributed. This was evident, for example, in his determination to ensure that every citizen had a stake in the country. The home-owning society that Singapore is today came out of this insight. This philosophy spun off many initiatives which are now defining features of the Singapore economy such as the extremely high home ownership rate, the use of Central Provident Fund savings to finance mortgages and the constant upgrading of public housing estates to enhance their value. If there was one contribution that stood out the most, it would be how he kept pushing Singapore to re-invent its economy every now and then. He had the foresight to anticipate economic challenges and opportunities well ahead of time while also coming out with strategies to respond effectively to the same. He was well ahead of the game in environmental protection when he pushed for Singapore as a Garden City. He foresaw the problems with road congestion and pushed for pro-active policies such as the Area Licensing Scheme which was the precursor to the current Electronic Road Pricing scheme: that made Singapore a world leader in using a market tool - pricing road congestion - to control traffic. He was also early in visualising the combination of telecommunications and computers and so pushed for Singapore to move rapidly in computerisation in the 1980s. He used the same uncanny long-range vision he had to raise the issue of ageing and declining fertility in the 1980s when few pundits were talking about it. One of his signal achievements was the push for financial liberalisation in the late 1990s which led to a surge of growth and created the global financial centre of today. He was also prescient in encouraging the growth of the Singapore economy's second wing in the late 1980s, when he realised that as the economy matured, it would need to look beyond the confines of its territorial limits to find growth opportunities. In particular, he played a decisive role in encouraging Singaporean companies to invest in China. His personal involvement in leading delegations to China and in conceiving projects for Singaporeans to transfer knowledge to China helped Singapore establish a foothold in China well beyond what its small size implied. In short, one of Singapore's great economic strengths is the ability to constantly reinvent itself - Mr Lee was instrumental in inculcating this ability and leading change when needed. Importantly, he combined this capacity for great vision with an unrelenting emphasis on focusing on the long term, so that the benefits of anticipating big changes were not sidetracked by the short-term pain that was sometimes necessary to achieve the bold vision. Many have remarked how there is a certain \"Singapore brand\" which helps its economy in many ways. The Singapore economy is seen as standing for certain qualities in a way few other countries are. Abroad, Singapore is seen as tough-minded, effective, honest and straight shooting, all values that Mr Lee inculcated in Singapore. He was Singapore's main marketeer, our main \"brand ambassador\" - his persona and ideas moulded the \"Singapore\" brand which brought in the foreign investment which transformed Singapore. What about the downsides? Mr Lee did not get everything right, of course. There were probably four areas where things may not have gone as well as they should have. In all these areas, the instincts were broadly right but adjustments to policy thinking to reflect changing circumstances were not made when they should have been. First, while welcoming multinational companies was absolutely the right call to make in the early stages of Singapore's development, there should have been a recalibration of that strategy to support the growth of local enterprise once Singapore had achieved a strong economic base, by the late 1970s. Consequently, many would argue that Singapore has become overly dependent on multinational companies while its own indigenous business sector has not been developed to produce a healthily diversified economy. Second, while again it was the right instinct to be open to foreign talent, even a good policy can be carried too far and too quickly. There are reasonable grounds to argue that the over-rapid inflow of foreign workers depressed wages at the low end and brought social costs which could have been avoided. While Mr Lee was not in charge of the economy when these policies were instituted, he was very much a supporter. Third, most Singaporeans would agree that they should not become hooked on social welfare, but as the economy matured and the global economy sustained a series of shocks, growth slowed and became more volatile, increasing economic insecurity even among the hardest working souls. This was compounded by developments in the medical field which raised healthcare costs. All this required greater emphasis to have been placed on creating social safety nets such as protection against unemployment and a more balanced division of the burden of healthcare funding between the average citizen and the state. Fourth, more could have been done on Mr Lee's watch to build economic linkages with the region. In the late 1980s, he spearheaded economic integration with Indonesia's Riau Islands but could not achieve the same with Malaysia. It was not entirely his fault that relations with Singapore's nearest neighbour were often fraught, as the bitter legacy of separation took a long time to dissipate but more could certainly have been done. On the whole, however, few would question that Mr Lee's overall contribution to economic development was immense and positive. The mark of truly historic personalities is not in their being able to avoid errors but in how they ensured that the mistakes were small while the achievements were grand. So it is with Lee Kuan Yew. When the great British architect Christopher Wren was interred in St Paul's Cathedral in 1723, the epithet read: \"Reader, if you seek his monument, look around you.\" One could say the same for Lee Kuan Yew: if you seek his monument, look around Singapore. As much in its political system as in the economy, no one has left such a strong and indelible imprint of himself in a country as Mr Lee has. And Singapore is so much the better for that.

      "text": "Lee Kuan Yew's meritocracy: a key reason for S'pore's separation from Ma'sia, his quotable quotes.. No one could accuse LKY of being weak When he suddenly fathered a reluctant new nation, the iron was forged in him. LEE Kuan Yew, former prime minister of Singapore, has died at the age of 91. He was born Harry Lee Kuan Yew on Sept 16, 1923 in Singapore. When he left England after graduating with a law degree from Cambridge University, he also left his English name behind. In 1954, Lee formed the People’s Action Party (PAP). In 1959, at the age of 35, he won the national elections of Singapore, then still part of the British Empire, and became Prime Minister for the first time. After a brief merger with Malaysia, in 1965 the Republic of Singapore was born. Lee was PM until 1990 when he voluntarily stepped down, at age 67, to make way for a younger man. It is a cliché, but it has to be said: the passing of Lee Kuan Yew is the passing of an era for Singapore and Singaporeans. A Singapore without LKY will take some adjusting to. Older citizens will probably remember him with more affection and gratitude. Younger Singaporeans may attend the academic institutions and win scholarships that bear his name, but they will likely feel no particular affection or disdain, but rather, a vague admiration for the legendary leader whom they have been told was the architect of modern Singapore.“I have been accused of many things in my life, but not even my worst enemy has ever accused me of being afraid to speak my mind,” he once said. Perhaps he will be best remembered through his own words. In 1980, he said, “Whoever governs Singapore must have that iron in him.” For him, it was in August 1965, when he suddenly fathered a reluctant new nation, that the iron was forged - from the fire in his belly to make Singapore succeed. From that “moment of anguish”, he would “spend the rest of my life getting Singapore not just to work but to prosper and flourish.” Over the years, he would use that same steel to fight all forms of obstacles and undesirable dogma, prejudices and even personal habits. He would go on to confront and battle challenges that included corruption, unemployment, poverty, communism, political opposition, smoking and at the end, his own deteriorating health. His self-belief and devotion to the Singapore cause was intense and absolute: “This is your life and mine. I’ve spent a whole lifetime building this (country) and as long as I’m in charge, nobody is going to knock it down.” He will be remembered for his ferocious fight against corruption. He believed vehemently, “The moment key leaders are less than incorruptible, less than stern in demanding high standards, from that moment, the structure of administrative integrity will weaken, and eventually crumble. Singapore can survive only if ministers and senior officers are incorruptible and efficient.” He will be remembered for standing up for meritocracy. A key reason for Singapore’s separation in 1965 was Lee’s belief in multiracial meritocracy. He was utterly convinced that, “If you want Singapore to succeed…you must have a system that enables the best man and the most suitable to go into the job that needs them…” Every time a Singaporean takes a ride in a bus along a tree-lined avenue, plays with her children in a park near their flat, or enjoys a picnic in Botanic Gardens, she might just think of Lee. He launched Tree Planting Day and “set out to transform Singapore into a tropical garden city.” He was completely certain that, “Greening raised the morale of people and gave them pride in their surroundings.” Lee’s beliefs and ideas went on to mould not just the development of a small new country with no natural resources to speak of, but also, some would argue, the personal lives of its citizens. Under his leadership, his government implemented policies and ran campaigns to compel and urge Singaporeans to save water, to keep Singapore clean, to have two children, and later, to have three if they could afford it, and to speak Mandarin, among many other exhortations. In response to critics who accused his government of interfering in the private lives and personal behaviours of the city-state’s inhabitants, he had this to say, “It has made Singapore a more pleasant place to live in. If this is a ‘nanny state’, I am proud to have fostered one.” He will be remembered for the power of his convictions. “I have never been over concerned or obsessed with opinion polls or popularity polls. I think a leader who is, is a weak leader.” No-one could accuse Lee Kuan Yew of being a weak leader. Of his own accord, he relinquished the position of Prime Minister in 1990, but stayed on in government as Senior Minister and then Minister Mentor in the governments of both his successors, Goh Chok Tong and his own son, Lee Hsien Loong, the current Prime Minister. He retired from Cabinet in 2011 but remained a Member of Parliament. For those who remember Lee Kuan Yew in his prime, no matter to which side of the political divide they belong, they will recall a perspicacious politician whose intellect found admirers far beyond the little red dot, a powerful orator whose words conquered crowds and carried generations of Singaporeans with him, and perhaps, most of all, a pragmatic visionary who, against all odds, made the improbable nation a reality. Lee was known for his admiration, gratitude and devotion to his wife, the late Kwa Geok Choo. He is survived by his two sons, one daughter and seven grandchildren.

Quotable quotes from Lee Kuan Yew L ee Kuan Yew commenting on death: 'There is an end to everything and I want mine to come as quickly and painlessly as possible, not with me incapacitated, half in coma in bed and with a tube going into my nostrils and down to my stomach.' – AFP pic, March 23, 2015 Here are some notable quotes from Singapore's founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, who died Monday at the age of 91. On Japan defeating Britain to occupy Singapore in 1942: \"The dark ages had descended on us. It was brutal, cruel. \"Looking back, it was the biggest single political education of my life because, for three and a half years, I saw the meaning of power and how power and politics and government went together, and I also understood how people trapped in a power situation responded because they had to live. \"One day the British were there, immovable, complete masters; next day, the Japanese, whom we derided, mocked as short, stunted people with short-sighted squint eyes.\" After World War II when the British were trying to reestablish control: \"... the old mechanisms had gone and the old habits of obedience and respect (for the British) had also gone because people had seen them run away (from the Japanese) ... they packed up. We were supposed, the local population was supposed to panic when the bombs fell, but we found they panicked more than we did. So it was no longer the old relationship.\" As a law student in Britain: \"Here in Singapore, you didn't come across the white man so much. He was in a superior position. \"But there you are (in Britain) in a superior position meeting white men and white women in an inferior position, socially, I mean. They have to serve you and so on in the shops. I saw no reason why they should be governing me; they're not superior. I decided when I got back, I was going to put an end to this.\" On opinion polls: \"I have never been overconcerned or obsessed with opinion polls or popularity polls. A leader who is, is a weak leader. If you are concerned with whether your rating will go up or down, then you are not a leader. You are just catching the wind ... you will go where the wind is blowing. That's not what I am in this for.\" On his iron-fisted governing style: \"Anybody who decides to take me on needs to put on knuckle-dusters. If you think you can hurt me more than I can hurt you, try.\" On his political opponents: \"If you are a troublemaker... it's our job to politically destroy you... Everybody knows that in my bag I have a hatchet, and a very sharp one. You take me on, I take my hatchet, we meet in the cul-de-sac.\" On democracy: \"You take a poll of any people. What is it they want? The right to write an editorial as you like? They want homes, medicine, jobs, schools.\" On justice: \"We have to lock up people, without trial, whether they are communists, whether they are language chauvinists, whether they are religious extremists. If you don't do that, the country would be in ruins.\" On his policy of matching male and female university graduates to produce smart babies: \"If you don't include your women graduates in your breeding pool and leave them on the shelf, you would end up a more stupid society... So what happens? There will be less bright people to support dumb people in the next generation. That's a problem.\" On criticism over the high pay of cabinet ministers and senior civil servants: \"The cure for all this talk is a good dose of incompetent government. You get that alternative and you'll never put Singapore together again: Humpty Dumpty cannot be put together again... and your asset values will be in peril, your security will be at risk and our women will become maids in other people's countries, foreign workers.\" On religion: \"I wouldn't call myself an atheist. I neither deny nor accept that there is a God. So I do not laugh at people who believe in God. But I do not necessarily believe in God – nor deny that there could be one.\" On his wife of 63 years, Kwa Geok Choo, who died in October 2010: \"Without her, I would be a different man, with a different life... I should find solace in her 89 years of a life well-lived. But at this moment of the final parting, my heart is heavy with sorrow and grief.\" On death: \"There is an end to everything and I want mine to come as quickly and painlessly as possible, not with me incapacitated, half in coma in bed and with a tube going into my nostrils and down to my stomach.\" On rising up from his grave if something goes wrong in Singapore: \"Even from my sickbed, even if you are going to lower me to the grave and I feel that something is going wrong, I will get up.\" Related post: Former Singapore prime minister Lee Kuan Yew waves to supporters as he submits his nomination papers to contest in the elections in Singapore...

      "text": "World | Agence France-Presse   11:25 IST Members of the public queue to pay their respects to Singapore's late former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew. (AFP Photo) Singapore: Singaporeans wept on the streets as they gathered in their thousands Wednesday to pay respects to founding leader Lee Kuan Yew, whose flag-draped coffin was transported in a gun carriage to parliament for public viewing. The coffin was taken from the Istana government complex -- Lee's workplace for decades as prime minister and cabinet adviser -- where his family had held a private wake. It will lie in state in Parliament House for public viewing until the weekend. The 91-year-old patriarch died Monday after more than half a century in politics, during which Singapore was transformed from a poor British colonial outpost into one of the world's richest societies. He will be cremated after full state honours on Sunday.Applause and shouts of \"We love you!\" and \"Lee Kuan Yew!\" broke out as the dark brown coffin, draped in the red-and-white Singapore flag, emerged inside a tempered glass case atop a gun carriage pulled by an open-topped military truck. In scenes that evoked Singapore's colonial past, Lee's coffin stopped in front of the Istana main building, where British administrators once worked, as a bagpiper from Singapore's Gurkha Contingent -- the city-state's special guard force -- played \"Auld Lang Syne\". It was brought down tree-lined Edinburgh Road to the Istana's main gate, and then made a slow turn to Parliament House as crowds including schoolgirls in uniform with black arm bands waited behind barricades. Many along the route were in tears as they raised cameras and mobile phones to record the historic event. Some threw flowers on the path of the carriage. People also watched from the windows of highrise buildings along the route. Local media said Singaporeans began queueing up after midnight Tuesday for a chance to be among the first to pay their respects to the man popularly known by his initials \"LKY\". Before Wednesday's lunch break, the line was already snaking for up to two kilometres (1.2 miles) as Singaporeans patiently awaited their turn to enter the viewing hall in the riverside parliament. The visiting hours were extended until midnight in response to the turnout. \"These are amazing scenes. I have not seen anything like this in my lifetime,\" bank executive Zhang Wei Jie, 36, told AFP. \"LKY is the founder of our country. It is a no-brainer that we have to pay respect. We have taken some time off from work, my supervisor is also here somewhere in the crowd.\" R. Tamilselvi, a 77-year-old grandmother, brought two of her granddaughters, each clutching flowers. \"Lee Kuan Yew has done so much for us. We used to live in squatter (colonies) in Sembawang, my husband was a bus driver. Now my three sons have good jobs and nice houses. The children all go to school. What will we be without Lee Kuan Yew?\"",

      "text": "Lee Kuan Yew: The Philosopher King 25 March 2015 13:09 WIB - Sumber : Dino Patti Djalal - Mantan Jubir Presiden SBY (2004–2010) - Editor : Riyon Tweet \nDari semua pemimpin dunia yang pernah saya temui, Lee Kuan Yew termasuk yang paling impresif. Dulu, sewaktu kuliah, saya belajar teori politik Plato bahwa pemimpin yang paling ideal adalah yang berkualitas “the philosopher king”: yang punya kekuasaan selayaknya seorang raja, namun serbatahu dan bijak seperti seorang filsuf. Tipe itu jarang sekali ada. Banyak orang yang berkuasa tapi tidak bijak dan banyak orang yang bijaksana tapi tidak punya kuasa. \nLee Kuan Yew adalah salah seorang philosopher king di Asia yang paling menonjol di abad ke-20. Ketika Singapura mendadak menjadi negara merdeka pada 1965 karena “diceraikan” Federasi Malaysia, Lee Kuan Yew mewarisi kondisi yang sangat memprihatinkan. Singapura tidak punya sumber alam, tidak punya modal, minim jati diri, dan digerogoti komunisme. Banyak yang meramal bahwa eksperimen kebangsaan di Singapura akan kandas. \nNamun, yang terjadi justru sebaliknya. Dengan kepemimpinan yang luar biasa, Lee dan rekan-rekan politiknya dalam People’s Action Party mengalahkan komunisme. Dan mengubah Singapura hanya dalam dua–tiga dekade menjadi negara maju, dengan nasionalisme yang kukuh. \nSingapura menjadi negara yang paling gesit beradaptasi dengan globalisasi: sebagai hub transportasi, kemudian hub perdagangan, hub manufaktur, hub finansial, dan dewasa ini sebagai hub inovasi. Prestasi terbesar LKY (Lee Kuan Yew), menurut saya, adalah membangun suatu negara di mana hukum benar-benar menjadi panglima dan membentuk suatu pemerintahan yang termasuk paling bersih di dunia. \nSebagai pemimpin, kekuatan LKY yang paling ampuh adalah intelektualitasnya. Pengetahuannya tidak ada batasnya. Analisisnya selalu tajam, begitu pula naluri politiknya. Dia tidak pernah defensif, tidak pernah kehilangan jawaban, dan jago berdebat mengenai isu apa pun. \nKarena itulah, para pemimpin dunia—mulai presiden Amerika Serikat, presiden Tiongkok, termasuk SBY sendiri dulu—gemar mencari LKY untuk menambah wawasan dan mendengar analisis beliau. Dari jajaran pemimpin Asia yang penuh gejolak (termasuk Orde Baru di Indonesia), Lee termasuk unik karena melengserkan diri di puncak kekuasaan. \nDan dia tidak memberikan takhta kepada putranya. Dia digantikan Goh Chok Tong sebagai perdana menteri dan beberapa tahun kemudian barulah putranya (Lee Hsien Loong) menggantikan Goh. LKY, pendeknya, menangani suksesi kepemimpinan Singapura dengan bijak. Dalam perjalanan karir saya sebagai diplomat, saya tiga kali bertemu Lee secara fokus. \nPertemuan pertama dilakukan bersama sejumlah tokoh muda di sebuah hotel di Jakarta. Ada 15 orang yang hadir dan LKY secara sistematis menjawab dengan apik setiap pertanyaan para peserta yang berasal dari berbagai kalangan. Saya yakin kami semua waktu itu berpikir, “Bapak satu ini ilmunya gak ada habis-habisnya.” \nPertemuan kedua lebih impresif. Masih sebagai juru bicara kepresidenan, saya bersama sejumlah tokoh muda menemui LKY di kantor perdana menteri Singapura. Setelah pertemuan berakhir, seorang staf membisikkan ke telinga saya, “Pak Dino, Anda jangan pulang dulu. Lee Kuan Yew ingin bertemu Anda empat mata.” Saya kemudian digiring sendirian ke lantai atas, tempat LKY sudah menunggu saya di meja kerjanya. \nSelama satu jam, dalam suasana hening malam dan tanpa pencatat, LKY menguras otak saya mengenai politik luar negeri Presiden SBY dan mengenai dinamika elite serta intrik politik di Jakarta. Pertanyaan beliau bertubi-tubi dan setiap jawaban saya ditimpali dengan observasi tambahan dari beliau sendiri. Saya mengamati bahwa LKY sebenarnya tahu secara detail rimba politik Indonesia. \nNamun, beliau selalu haus informasi baru—khususnya insights—yang bisa menajamkan analisisnya. Yang kemudian saya ketahui, LKY tidak pernah menolak bertemu siapa pun dan dari mana pun (bahkan pejabat yang bukan senior) asal beliau dapat “sesuatu” yang baru. Tidak banyak pemimpin yang melakukan metode seperti itu. \nPertemuan ketiga terjadi pada 29 Agustus tahun lalu, ketika saya diundang untuk memberi pidato di Pyramid Club sehubungan dengan Hari Kemerdekaan Singapura. Pyramid Club adalah kumpulan elite politik dan ekonomi Singapura. Dalam acara yang sangat tertutup tersebut, tidak boleh ada media dan saya dilarang membawa kamera (keesokan harinya sama sekali tidak ada berita mengenai acara tersebut). \nMalam itu hadir PM Lee Hsien Loong dan sejumlah anggota kabinet. Namun, yang paling berarti bagi saya adalah kehadiran LKY di tengah berita mengenai kondisi kesehatannya. Jujurnya, saya sempat agak kikuk berbicara di depan LKY yang selama ini saya kagumi. Namun, rasa grogi itu segera hilang ketika saya melihat beliau tertawa mendengar beberapa joke saya yang menggoda beliau. \nKetika pidato saya berakhir, saya sempat mengantar LKY ke mobil dan beliau menyapa saya dengan senyuman, mungkin karena susah berbicara. Saya teringat beliau berjalan tertatih-tatih, namun tetap penuh semangat hidup. Saya tidak akan pernah melupakan tatapan mata lembut beliau malam itu. Saya sudah berfirasat mungkin itu terakhir kalinya saya melihat figur LKY. \nAda perasaan lirih di hati saya. Karena saya tahu bahwa LKY adalah anak zaman yang tidak akan tergantikan oleh siapa pun. Lee Kuan Yew mengembuskan napas terakhir pukul 03.18 tanggal 23 Maret 2015. Pelajaran—dan inspirasi—paling berharga dari LKY adalah kepemimpinan dan kompetensi dapat menjadi faktor terpenting perubahan nasib suatu bangsa. Pelajaran ini juga sangat penting bagi bangsa Indonesia. (*) LOGIN untuk mengomentari.",

      "text": "Dear Sinkapore,\nAfter LKY up the hearse, so much talks in coffeeshops and everywhere, some stories very interesting , some very funny.\nWe piece them together for your read, pls spread the stories around for fun reading .\nOK, This is their stories ---\nTo many people, the death of LKY is very surreal, likened to strike lottery …..and lottery –counter cashiers are ringing non-stop like CNY days . Numbers like 8898, 9191, all cannot buy in right ? You try?\nMass-media people all siao liao, non-stop bombarding the islanders like no tomorrows but only yesterdays right ? Everybody is getting the propaganda headache , in melancholy ?\nSome people cry, many celebrate quietly at heart, this is politics right, no one right or wrong, politics is everything in sinkapore.\nYou know, many people say the 7 days of tribute to Ah Yew on the ground or in the air, in the concerted effort by these PAP people ….is like a General Election without opposition. Ghost against ghost competition. Many believe that PAP is using this tribute to sway votes too early.\nThe wiser ones ask ---what is the legacy? Do we really have an old hero dropped dead for sinkapore?\nThey compare to late Mr Ho Chih Minh of Vietnam , a poor leader who fought with arms for Vietnam , died a poor hero, mummified for his true-blue contributions.\nPeople say LKY got contributed to sinkapore but he was well compensated, in other words, he was paid decently to do a job or he could resign in the first place right?\nNo man is an island, it is near impossible to say one man built a nation, LKY might be the key conductor but without the good orchestra , there would be no good music , and LKY would be just another HDB uncle right !\nEvery country also got improvement. Every country also got history, but people cannot live in the past and pay the present bills right ?\nLKY is not god or sage. He just happened to be an educated person, wriggle in to get an opportunity to find votes and held sway. They say in the land of blind, one eye jack is king right.\nIf ong eng guan or Lim chin siong is the so-called “victor” of the political game, the success story would also be different right.\nMany say Sinkapore would still improve without LKY in the past, success comes with different goals and inspirations. People can sort of look up at LKY but worshipping is not a good thing to do right !\nPeople ask ---are concrete jungles and crowded MRT a success story ? Modern Sinkaporeans with no cultures and values, happy with life quality in a costly environment and stagnant wages?\nYou cannot expect people to live in LKY past and pay the expensive reality right?\nIn the past, 3- room HDB flat only cost 7 k, now is 300K, how do you compare apple to apple ?\nOpposition parties must remember to talk about the cost of living in the past and in the present next GE.\nYou know many people believe that the WP Scarecrow effect has shooed the big bird away for good.\nBreaking one PAP GRC is a heartache , brought down the Punggol east SMC under the hammer is another killer. Many thought he would live till 100 still carry the hatchet in his bag.\nFrustration and anger can really botch a healthy person right ?\nWorkers Party MPs must now reform themselves and speak up relevant issues and propose ideas good for the people. Aim for 50.5% win next GE if not 55%.\nAs for now , LKY is nothing, we can look back and perhaps see some of things he has done for sinkapore, afterall, building sinkapore is everybody effort past or present, no one is god in sinkapore government , they are paid handsomely, even during the mourning period right!\nAs to whether LKY died in peace or died in frustration, no one knows, only LKY would know in his last hours, but certainly he understood One PAP GRC and one more PAP SMC were brought down by WP . The rest is already history.\nMany people say if the tribute is aimed at winning votes, it will not work. We know his story when he was alive, excessive promoting his past story after his death becomes an overkill.\nMeanwhile…….the media madness continues……the haunting will carry on until Sunday while the body is decaying by the hours……and when this is over….will sinkapore need to see another up the lorry to see a new Sinkapore?\nHope you like the stories we bring to you from gossips and coffeeshops.\nThank you .\nGod help sinkaporeans to have a better life and have more space to breathe. Other things are just passing clouds if our pockets are empty even if our spirits are full right !",

His birth date is 16/09/1923 and the hearse’s number plate was 8898.

The PA also organises community visits by government leaders and fosters the emergence of community leaders, through Community Club Management Committees and Residents’ Committees. \nYesterday, past and present PA staff and members of the public began streaming in after the tribute centre opened at noon, with the numbers swelling to more than 3,000 within four hours. Queues formed to sign the condolence books, while many stayed behind to watch a tribute video to Lee, which was played on a large screen. \nA long-time PA staff member Peh Seow Kuan, who is now constituency manager of Tanjong Pagar CC, said Lee inspired her and her colleagues to take their work seriously. “When Lee was working, he was very serious and meticulous. And that made us feel like we should, in turn, try to be like him, and be serious in our work,” said the 66-year-old. \nLong Khin Suan, a former regional officer with PA, added: “Lee was able to think of things in a wider picture, of things that we normally wouldn’t be able to think of.” \nHe remembered the time when he and his colleagues had made a mistake and felt bad and guilty about it. But Lee did not blame them, saying that it was only a small matter. \nBut Lee had a softer side that shone through when he attended events, said Peh. \n“He was actually really amiable, despite how serious he was all the time. He was quite friendly — it was so easy for people to talk to him,” she said. “Lee would talk to the children of staff members and participants while at events. He would ask the children questions, advise their parents, and joke with them. He was a person who would always take care of other people.” \nThese contrasting sides of Lee was what PA chief executive director Ang Hak Seng admired the most about Singapore’s founding Prime Minister. “He was a leader — a leader who would not hesitate to make difficult decisions, a leader who cared for his people, a leader with vision who made people have faith in him and follow him,” he said. — TODAY   MORE ON MMOTV Cover Media Video: Disney signs Tim Burton for ‘Dumbo’ remake (00:50) \nRevered film maker Tim Burton has signed on to re-team with Disney for a live action adaptation of the classic animated tale ‘Dumbo’. ― Cover Media Most Viewed",

If GE is next week PAP will win at least 85% and landslide win in Aljunied. I speak as an observer.\nWith the demise of Harry Lee, the PAP may not hold the admiration and respect he held over the voters who cast their votes in PAP (Harry's?) favour. No one else in the party (or politics in Singapore) has been able to manipulate the electorate and position him on such a high pedestal as accomplished by LKY. I'd say the whole cabinet is a group of \"yes-men\" fortunate to ride on Harry's reputation, including LHL, who would not be where he is if not for daddy. From now on, it is uphill for PAP to maintain her top-dog position. Whilst the opposition parties may not yet have build a team to form a government, it is left to the PAP to lay a road for Singapore's future, which they have no idea of what to do for the future. Below is an article from a foreign newspaper; I am sure most readers will agree with it.\nCheers!\nhttp://asia.nikkei.com/Politics-Econ...le-edged-sword\nMarch 25, 2015 5:20 am JST\nSingapore's single-party model a double-edged sword\nWATARU YOSHIDA, MAYUKO TANI and TOMOMI KIKUCHI, Nikkei staff writers\n-- After the end of the Cold War, American-style democracy was touted as superior. The combination of democracy and a market economy that had emerged victorious over the oppressive Communist bloc was considered the key to prosperity.\nEmerging countries in Asia seeking to maintain one-party rule turned to an exception: Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore.\nAnother road to growth\nThe People's Action Party built by Lee has maintained its grip on power for 50 years. Free speech in Singapore is limited, while companies enjoying indirect government investment wield considerable clout.\nThis school of thought, which prioritizes national survival above all else, has been called \"Asian-style democracy.\" It has met with criticism over human rights issues, but the miraculous prosperity it spawned is undeniable.\nIn November 1978, then-Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping visited an industrial zone in western Singapore. The area had been developed under Lee's auspices, drawing foreign investment through tax breaks and simplified regulations.\nDeng remarked afterward that he saw what Singapore had gained from these factories built by foreigners. The next month, he took the reins of the Chinese government under the slogan \"reform and opening up.\" The roots of China's turning point from the devastation of the Cultural Revolution to its ascent as the world's factory lie in Singapore.\nThe Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore teaches the nuts and bolts of Asian-style democracy. Of its roughly 2,000 graduates, more than 500 have been Chinese exchange students. Many have been promising young bureaucrats. China even now takes cues from Singapore for growth.\nMeanwhile, the island of Phu Quoc in southern Vietnam, close to neighboring Cambodia, has been dubbed \"Vietnam's Singapore.\" It has been made a special economic zone, with looser regulations to entice foreign businesses.\nMeans vs. ends\nBut Lee's alternative path of growth under single-party rule may not work everywhere.\nThe big difference between Singapore and such cases as China and Vietnam is that Lee opted for political stability under one party to help create growth, while his imitators consider growth necessary to maintain their existing systems. This reversal of ends and means has created political and economic distortions in countries following in Lee's footsteps.\nOne example is transparency. Lee hated corruption and immediately ousted any bureaucrats suspected of it. By contrast, graft still runs rampant in many emerging Asian countries. Complex regulations continue to prop up massive governments, hindering companies trying to set up shop.\nThe openness of their economies differs considerably as well. In the 2000s, many in Singapore expressed alarm over the entry of low-cost airlines. But Lee brushed aside their objections, saying he did not care whether Singapore Airlines lost market share.\nThe country also has free trade agreements with Japan, the U.S. and China as well as emerging markets. Meanwhile, China and many Southeast Asian countries have been too worried about protecting local industry to properly open up trade.\nA warped form of the Asian-style democracy formulated by Lee has spread throughout emerging nations. China's growth is slowing, and Vietnam's has its ups and its downs. An eruption of discontent could threaten stability in these countries should single-party rule, once a means to an end, instead come to hobble growth.",

      "text": "To all the PAP IB minions here: it's time for you to gloat. Years of sucking up to the West (US in particular) has earned old fart this glowing tribute from Kissinger. And to those of you who still insist that LKY's heart lies with China and Asia: I say, fuck you and open your eyes. Old fart has always been the US' ass-wipe. Period.\nHenry A. Kissinger: The world will miss Lee Kuan Yew\nhttps://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/im...EeSmL-50WRGk_w\nSingapore's former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew speaks during his book launch at the Istana in Singapore in this August 6, 2013 file photo. (Edgar Su/Reuters)\nBy Henry A. Kissinger\nMarch 23\nHenry A. Kissinger was secretary of state from 1973 to 1977.\nLee Kuan Yew was a great man. And he was a close personal friend, a fact that I consider one of the great blessings of my life. A world needing to distill order from incipient chaos will miss his leadership.\nLee emerged onto the international stage as the founding father of the state of Singapore, then a city of about 1 million. He developed into a world statesman who acted as a kind of conscience to leaders around the globe.\nFate initially seemed not to have provided him a canvas on which to achieve more than modest local success. In the first phase of decolonization, Singapore emerged as a part of Malaya. It was cut loose because of tensions between Singapore’s largely Chinese population and the Malay majority and, above all, to teach the fractious city a lesson of dependency. Malaya undoubtedly expected that reality would cure Singapore of its independent spirit.\nBut great men become such through visions beyond material calculations. Lee defied conventional wisdom by opting for statehood. The choice reflected a deep faith in the virtues of his people. He asserted that a city located on a sandbar with nary an economic resource to draw upon, and whose major industry as a colonial naval base had disappeared, could nevertheless thrive and achieve international stature by building on its principal asset: the intelligence, industry and dedication of its people.\nA great leader takes his or her society from where it is to where it has never been — indeed, where it as yet cannot imagine being. By insisting on quality education, by suppressing corruption and by basing governance on merit, Lee and his colleagues raised the annual per capita income of their population from $500 at the time of independence in 1965 to roughly $55,000 today. In a generation, Singapore became an international financial center, the leading intellectual metropolis of Southeast Asia, the location of the region’s major hospitals and a favored site for conferences on international affairs. It did so by adhering to an extraordinary pragmatism: by opening careers to the best talents and encouraging them to adopt the best practices from all over the world.\nSuperior performance was one component of that achievement. Superior leadership was even more important. As the decades went by, it was moving — and inspirational — to see Lee, in material terms the mayor of a medium-size city, bestride the international scene as a mentor of global strategic order. A visit by Lee to Washington was a kind of national event. A presidential conversation was nearly automatic; eminent members of the Cabinet and Congress would seek meetings. They did so not to hear of Singapore’s national problems; Lee rarely, if ever, lobbied policymakers for assistance. His theme was the indispensable U.S. contribution to the defense and growth of a peaceful world. His interlocutors attended not to be petitioned but to learn from one of the truly profound global thinkers of our time.\nThis process started for me when Lee visited Harvard in 1967 shortly after becoming prime minister of an independent Singapore. Lee began a meeting with the senior faculty of the School of Public Administration (now the Kennedy School) by inviting comments on the Vietnam War. The faculty, of which I was one dissenting member, was divided primarily on the question of whether President Lyndon Johnson was a war criminal or a psychopath. Lee responded, “You make me sick” — not because he embraced war in a personal sense but because the independence and prosperity of his country depended on the fortitude, unity and resolve of the United States. Singapore was not asking the United States to do something that Singapore would not undertake to the maximum of its ability. But U.S. leadership was needed to supplement and create a framework for order in the world.\nLee elaborated on these themes in the hundreds of encounters I had with him during international conferences, study groups, board meetings, face-to-face discussions and visits at each other’s homes over 45 years. He did not exhort; he was never emotional; he was not a Cold Warrior; he was a pilgrim in quest of world order and responsible leadership. He understood the relevance of China and its looming potential and often contributed to the enlightenment of the world on this subject. But in the end, he insisted that without the United States there could be no stability.\nLee’s domestic methods fell short of the prescriptions of current U.S. constitutional theory. But so, in fairness, did the democracy of Thomas Jefferson’s time, with its limited franchise, property qualifications for voting and slavery. This is not the occasion to debate what other options were available. Had Singapore chosen the road of its critics, it might well have collapsed among its ethnic groups, as the example of Syria teaches today. Whether the structures essential for the early decades of Singapore’s independent existence were unnecessarily prolonged can be the subject of another discussion.\nI began this eulogy by mentioning my friendship with Lee. He was not a man of many sentimental words. And he nearly always spoke of substantive matters. But one could sense his attachment. A conversation with Lee, whose life was devoted to service and who spent so much of his time on joint explorations, was a vote of confidence that sustained one’s sense of purpose.\nThe great tragedy of Lee’s life was that his beloved wife was felled by a stroke that left her a prisoner in her body, unable to communicate or receive communication. Through all that time, Lee sat by her bedside in the evening reading to her. He had faith that she understood despite the evidence to the contrary.\nPerhaps this was Lee Kuan Yew’s role in his era. He had the same hope for our world. He fought for its better instincts even when the evidence was ambiguous. But many of us heard him and will never forget him.",

They refuse to integrate their own non-bumi Citizens.\nSame example everywhere. In Asia, the \"family above nation\" culture is strong.

      "text": "Lee lies in state as Singaporeans bid farewell 25 Mar 2015 at 13:45 128 viewed 0 comments WRITER: AFP - + SINGAPORE - Singaporeans wept on the streets as they gathered in their thousands on Wednesday to pay respects to founding leader Lee Kuan Yew, whose flag-draped coffin was transported in a gun carriage to parliament for public viewing. \nThe body of Singapore's former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew lies in state at Parliament House for public viewing, ahead of his funeral, on March 25, 2015 \nThe coffin was taken from the Istana government complex -- Lee's workplace for decades as prime minister and cabinet adviser -- where his family had held a private wake. \nIt will lie in state in Parliament House for public viewing until the weekend. \nThe 91-year-old patriarch died Monday after more than half a century in politics, during which Singapore was transformed from a poor British colonial outpost into one of the world's richest societies. \nHe will be cremated after full state honours on Sunday. \nApplause and shouts of \"We love you!\" and \"Lee Kuan Yew!\" broke out as the dark brown coffin, draped in the red-and-white Singapore flag, emerged inside a tempered glass case atop a gun carriage pulled by an open-topped military truck. \nIn scenes that evoked Singapore's colonial past, Lee's coffin stopped in front of the Istana main building, where British administrators once worked, as a bagpiper from Singapore's Gurkha Contingent -- the city-state's special guard force -- played \"Auld Lang Syne\". \nIt was brought down tree-lined Edinburgh Road to the Istana's main gate, and then made a slow turn to Parliament House as crowds including schoolgirls in uniform with black arm bands waited behind barricades. \nMany along the route were in tears as they raised cameras and mobile phones to record the historic event. Some threw flowers on the path of the carriage. \nPeople also watched from the windows of highrise buildings along the route. \nLocal media said Singaporeans began queueing up after midnight Tuesday for a chance to be among the first to pay their respects to the man popularly known by his initials \"LKY\". \nBefore Wednesday's lunch break, the line was already snaking for up to two kilometres (1.2 miles) as Singaporeans patiently awaited their turn to enter the viewing hall in the riverside parliament. \nThe visiting hours were extended until midnight in response to the turnout. \n\"These are amazing scenes. I have not seen anything like this in my lifetime,\" bank executive Zhang Wei Jie, 36, told AFP. \n\"LKY is the founder of our country. It is a no-brainer that we have to pay respect. We have taken some time off from work, my supervisor is also here somewhere in the crowd.\" \nR. Tamilselvi, a 77-year-old grandmother, brought two of her granddaughters, each clutching flowers. \n\"Lee Kuan Yew has done so much for us. We used to live in squatter (colonies) in Sembawang, my husband was a bus driver. Now my three sons have good jobs and nice houses. The children all go to school. What will we be without Lee Kuan Yew?\" \n  1 people liked / 0  ",

      "text": "People say PAP grassloots and mass media go into hysteria aftermath of LKY s death. Dear Sinkapore,\nAfter LKY up the hearse, so much talks in coffeeshops and everywhere, some stories very interesting , some very funny.\nWe piece them together for your read, pls spread the stories around for fun reading .\nOK, This is their stories ---\nTo many people, the death of LKY is very surreal, likened to strike lottery …..and lottery –counter cashiers are ringing non-stop like CNY days . Numbers like 8898, 9191, all cannot buy in right ? You try?\nMass-media people all siao liao, non-stop bombarding the islanders like no tomorrows but only yesterdays right ? Everybody is getting the propaganda headache , in melancholy ?\nSome people cry, many celebrate quietly at heart, this is politics right, no one right or wrong, politics is everything in sinkapore.\nYou know, many people say the 7 days of tribute to Ah Yew on the ground or in the air, in the concerted effort by these PAP people ….is like a General Election without opposition. Ghost against ghost competition. Many believe that PAP is using this tribute to sway votes too early.\nThe wiser ones ask ---what is the legacy? Do we really have an old hero dropped dead for sinkapore?\nThey compare to late Mr Ho Chih Minh of Vietnam , a poor leader who fought with arms for Vietnam , died a poor hero, mummified for his true-blue contributions.\nPeople say LKY got contributed to sinkapore but he was well compensated, in other words, he was paid decently to do a job or he could resign in the first place right?\nNo man is an island, it is near impossible to say one man built a nation, LKY might be the key conductor but without the good orchestra , there would be no good music , and LKY would be just another HDB uncle right !\nEvery country also got improvement. Every country also got history, but people cannot live in the past and pay the present bills right ?\nLKY is not god or sage. He just happened to be an educated person, wriggle in to get an opportunity to find votes and held sway. They say in the land of blind, one eye jack is king right.\nIf ong eng guan or Lim chin siong is the so-called “victor” of the political game, the success story would also be different right.\nMany say Sinkapore would still improve without LKY in the past, success comes with different goals and inspirations. People can sort of look up at LKY but worshipping is not a good thing to do right !\nPeople ask ---are concrete jungles and crowded MRT a success story ? Modern Sinkaporeans with no cultures and values, happy with life quality in a costly environment and stagnant wages?\nYou cannot expect people to live in LKY past and pay the expensive reality right?\nIn the past, 3- room HDB flat only cost 7 k, now is 300K, how do you compare apple to apple ?\nOpposition parties must remember to talk about the cost of living in the past and in the present next GE.\nYou know many people believe that the WP Scarecrow effect has shooed the big bird away for good.\nBreaking one PAP GRC is a heartache , brought down the Punggol east SMC under the hammer is another killer. Many thought he would live till 100 still carry the hatchet in his bag.\nFrustration and anger can really botch a healthy person right ?\nWorkers Party MPs must now reform themselves and speak up relevant issues and propose ideas good for the people. Aim for 50.5% win next GE if not 55%.\nAs for now , LKY is nothing, we can look back and perhaps see some of things he has done for sinkapore, afterall, building sinkapore is everybody effort past or present, no one is god in sinkapore government , they are paid handsomely, even during the mourning period right!\nAs to whether LKY died in peace or died in frustration, no one knows, only LKY would know in his last hours, but certainly he understood One PAP GRC and one more PAP SMC were brought down by WP . The rest is already history.\nMany people say if the tribute is aimed at winning votes, it will not work. We know his story when he was alive, excessive promoting his past story after his death becomes an overkill.\nMeanwhile…….the media madness continues……the haunting will carry on until Sunday while the body is decaying by the hours……and when this is over….will sinkapore need to see another up the lorry to see a new Sinkapore?\nHope you like the stories we bring to you from gossips and coffeeshops.\nThank you .\nGod help sinkaporeans to have a better life and have more space to breathe. Other things are just passing clouds if our pockets are empty even if our spirits are full right ! Last edited by Tiu Kwang Yew; Today at 04:58 AM .",

Photograph: Mohd Rasfan/AFP/Getty Agence France-Presse in Singapore Share on WhatsApp \nSingaporeans have wept on the streets and gathered in their thousands to pay their respects to the country’s founding leader, Lee Kuan Yew, as his coffin was transported on a gun carriage to parliament for public viewing. \nAfter a two-day private wake for the family, the coffin was taken on Wednesday from the Istana government complex, Lee’s workplace for decades as prime minister and cabinet adviser, to the legislature, where his body will lie in state until the weekend. \nThe 91-year-old patriarch died on Monday after half a century in government, during which Singapore was transformed from a poor British colonial outpost into one of the world’s richest societies. Lee will be cremated after full state honours on Sunday. \nRelated: Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew, 'a true giant of history', dies aged 91 \nHis son, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, said there were “overwhelming queues” outside parliament and that visiting hours had been extended until midnight to cope with the turnout. \nApplause and shouts of “We love you” and “Lee Kuan Yew” broke out as the dark brown wooden coffin, draped in the red-and-white Singapore flag, emerged from the Istana inside a tempered glass case on a gun carriage pulled by an open-topped military truck. \nEarlier, in scenes that evoked Singapore’s colonial past, Lee’s coffin stopped in front of the complex’s main building, where British administrators once worked, as a piper from Singapore’s Gurkha Contingent – the city-state’s special guard force – played Auld Lang Syne. \nIt was brought down the tree-lined Edinburgh Road to the Istana’s main gate and then made a turn in the direction of parliament as a crowd including students in uniform with black armbands waited behind barricades. \nMany along the route were in tears as they raised cameras and mobile phones to record the event. Some threw flowers on the path of the carriage. Office workers watched from the windows of high-rise buildings along the route. \nPresident Tony Tan and his wife Mary were the first to pay their respects after Lee’s closed coffin was placed in the foyer of Parliament House. Local media said Singaporeans began queuing after midnight on Tuesday for a chance to be among the first to pay their respects to the man popularly known by his initials LKY. \nEven before the lunch break, the queue was already snaking for up to two kilometres (1.2 miles) as Singaporeans awaited their turn to enter the viewing hall. Many unfurled umbrellas to shield themselves from the scorching sun, with temperatures in the humid tropical island hitting 33C (91F) at midday. \nThey came from all walks of life, from office workers and managers to students and the elderly in wheelchairs. \n“These are amazing scenes. I have not seen anything like this in my lifetime,” bank executive Zhang Wei Jie, 36, told AFP. “LKY is the founder of our country. It is a no-brainer that we have to pay respect. We have taken some time off from work, my supervisor is also here somewhere in the crowd.” \nRelated: The Guardian view on Lee Kuan Yew: a new generation should build on his successes, not rest on them | Editorial \nMargaret Quek, 49, added: “I don’t mind waiting until night-time.” \nR Tamilselvi, 77, brought two of her granddaughters, each clutching flowers. “Lee Kuan Yew has done so much for us.
